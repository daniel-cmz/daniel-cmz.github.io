I am a PhD student in the <a href='https://cde.nus.edu.sg/did/'>Division of Industrial Design</a> at the <a href='https://nus.edu.sg/'>National University of Singapore</a>, supervised by Janghee Cho and Jung-Joo Lee. My research lies at the intersection of Design, Care, and Sociotechnical Futures. 

I explore how everyday practices, through which care networks are made, sustained, and negotiated can serve as grounded entry points for speculative and participatory design. Focusing on migrant workers, whose perspectives are frequently excluded in dominant future imaginaries, I examine how relational labour is enacted. Through qualitative research and collaborative design engagements, I analyse everyday practices and mobilise these situated insights to speculate on alternative futures of the care economy that emerge from, rather than abstract away from, lived experience.

I completed my Master’s degree in Industrial Design in the Postgraduate Programme in Industrial Design at the National University of Mexico. My research has been published in venues such as Journal of Futures Studies and Economía Creativa.
